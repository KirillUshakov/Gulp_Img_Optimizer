Gulp ImgOptimizer

Instruction: 
1. Put your images in a folder located in 'app/img/default'
2. Launch gulp using the console.
3. Your images will be optimized few moments later and they'll be in a folder located in 'app/img/optimized'

You could add new images when gulp is already running and images will be optimized soon. 

Change gulpfile.js if u want and enjoy !
